# Elevator System Simulator
---
## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

**Frontend (fe/):**
- React
- Vite
- TypeScript
- WebSockets (Socket.IO Client)

**Backend (be/):**
- NestJS
- TypeScript
- WebSockets (Socket.IO)

## âš¡Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v22)
- Git

## âš¡ Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/StanleyPete/elevator-system-simulator
cd elevator-system-simulator
````

### 2. Install all dependencies
```bash
npm run install-all
````

## âš¡ Running
The backend and frontend need to run in separate terminals. 
Make sure backend is run first.
### 1. Start the Backend
Open the first terminal and navigate to the backend folder:
```bash
cd be
npm run start
````
### 2. Start the FrontEnd
```bash
cd fe
npm run dev
````
### 3. Open the application
Once both backend and frontend are running, open your browser and go to:
```bash
http://localhost:5173
````

## ðŸ›  Implemented Solutions
### 1. Frontend
- *Note: I'm not a designer, so the UI is functional but intentionally simple.*
- React + Vite + TypeScript for fast, modern frontend development.
- Socket.IO Client to receive real-time updates from the backend.
- Displays elevator positions, requests, and movement in a visual UI.
### 2. Backend
- NestJS for scalable and structured server architecture.
- Written in TypeScript for type safety and better maintainability.
- Handles elevator logic, requests queue, and WebSocket connections.
### 3. Real-time Communication
- Used Socket.IO on both backend and frontend for real-time communication between elevators and the UI.
- Ensures instant updates of elevator positions and requests without page reloads.
### 4. Project Structure
- **Monorepo setup** with separate `be/` and `fe/` folders, managed from a root `package.json`.
- Scripts to install dependencies and run both frontend and backend easily.

## ðŸš€ Elevator System Features & Optimizations

- **Dynamic Floors and Elevators**  
  The frontend sends settings (`totalFloors`, `numberOfElevators`) to the backend, allowing the system to support any number of floors and elevators.  
  The backend automatically maps elevators and their starting positions, making this solution scalable for both a 10-floor building and a 100-floor skyscraper with multiple elevators.
  - *Note: The frontend visualization is currently limited to 10 floors and 3 elevators for display purposes.*

- **Intelligent Internal Panel Queue**  
  Requests from elevator internal panels are sorted based on the elevatorâ€™s current direction. For example, if the elevator is moving up, new requests in the same direction are added in ascending order, reducing unnecessary floor skipping.

- **Multiple-Click Prevention**  
  Floor call buttons and internal panel buttons are blocked from repeated activation until the request is fulfilled. Button color indicates pending calls on the frontend.

- **Safe Handling of Current Floor Requests**  
  If an elevator is already on the requested floor, clicking the button does nothing and does not turn it green, avoiding unnecessary signals or visual bugs.

- **Separate WebSocket Events**  
  The backend emits distinct events: `elevatorUpdate`, `elevatorStopped`, and `panelButtonReset`. This allows the frontend to accurately update elevator states and button statuses while minimizing unnecessary data transfer.

- **Optimized Queue for Dynamic Requests**  
  Floor requests in the queue are sorted efficiently, allowing elevators to serve calls in order without sudden direction changes or inefficient floor jumps.

- **User-Friendly and Predictable**  
  These improvements make the system flexible, predictable, and intuitive, while the backend logic reflects real-world elevator behavior more accurately.
